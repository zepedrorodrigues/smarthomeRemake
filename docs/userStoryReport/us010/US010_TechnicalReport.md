## 1. Requirements

_As Product Owner, I want the system to have a type of sensor that measures
temperature (C)._

Requirements for a sensor of temperature:

- The sensor must know the device that it belongs to.
- The sensor must be able to provide the current temperature.
- The sensor must provide the temperature value in Celsius.

### Dependency on other User Stories

Although the **US010** does not have a direct dependency on other user stories, it is worth noting that **US007**(... I want to add a sensor to an existing device in
a room. The sensor must be of a model of an existing type of sensor) is deeply connected to this user story. In the context 
of the **US007**, the sensor added to the device could be the one described in this user story.

Also, itÂ´s important to mention that a `SensorOfTemperature` returns a specific value, `TemperatureValue`, and a class was created to represent
this value in the system as well.

## 2. Analysis

The SensorOfTemperature class is composed by the following attributes:

| Attribute           | Rules                                                                                                                                  |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **SensorId**        | Must be a unique identifier. It is generated automatically.                                                                            |
| **DeviceId**        | Must not be null or empty. Must correspond to an existing device identity saved in the system.                                         |
| **SensorModelName** | Must not be null or empty. Must correspond to an existing model saved in the system.                                                   |
| **Value**           | Must be a TemperatureValue object that represents the current temperature. At the moment this is a default value for testing purposes. |

The TemperatureValue, which is created in the context of the SensorOfTemperature class, is composed by the following attributes:

| Attribute            | Rules                                                                                              |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **temperatureValue** | Must be a double that represents the current temperature and handles negative and positive values. |

The interaction with the sensor of temperature involves:

1. Requesting the current temperature (for now the system generates a default value, as
there is not yet a connection to the hardware that provides this information).
2. The system returns the current temperature value in a decimal format(Celsius).

### Sequence Diagram

A sequence diagram for **US010** is not provided, since the only requirement is for the system to have a sensor that provides
the current temperature. So, there is no interaction with other components or actors in the system at the moment.

### Applied Design Patterns and Principles

* **Information Expert and Single Responsibility** - Each created class is focused on a single responsibility. Also each class knows how to manage its own data and responsibilities encapsulating the logic within the class itself.


* **Creator** - The _SensorFactory_ class plays a crucial role in the creation of sensors, including _SensorOfTemperature_.
  It encapsulates the logic required to instantiate any sensor, ensuring that each sensor is created with a valid state
  and associated with the correct device and sensor model.


* **Low Coupling** - By decoupling the creation process from the _SensorOfTemperature_ class responsibilities, the system gains flexibility. Adjustments to how sensors are created or initialized can be made
  independently of their core functionalities.


* **High Cohesion** - The _SensorOfTemperature_ class is responsible for managing temperature sensor data, while the 
  _SensorRepository_ class is solely concerned with storing and retrieving sensor information and the _SensorFactory_ 
  class is responsible for creating sensors. This separation ensures that classes are focused and understandable.


* **Repository** - The _SensorRepository_, _SensorTypeRepository_, and _SensorModelRepository_ classes act as Repository
  patterns, providing a way to store and retrieve sensor data, sensor types, and sensor models, respectively.


* **Interface Segregation Principle(ISP)** - The _Sensor_ interface defines a contract for sensor behavior without imposing any
  unnecessary methods on the implementing classes, such as _SensorOfTemperature_. This follows the ISP by ensuring that implementing classes only need to provide implementations for methods that make sense for their
  specific type of sensor.


* **Value Object** - The _TemperatureValue_ class is a value object that encapsulates the current temperature value. 
  By treating the temperature value as a value object, the system ensures that the value is immutable and can be shared without risk of modification.

## 4. Tests

### Acceptance Tests

- `Scenario 1:` Create and associate a sensor of temperature with a device.
    - **Given** the system is equipped with devices.
    - **When** a user requests to add a sensor of temperature to a device.
    - **Then** the system should be able to create and save a sensor of temperature.


- `Scenario 2:` Retrieving the current temperature from a device.
    - **Given** the system is equipped with devices that have temperature sensors.
    - **When** a user requests the current temperature from a device(sensor).
    - **Then** the system should provide the current temperature.

### Unit Tests

classes.

### Integration Tests

Integration tests are not specified for **US010** at this time.

## 5. Implementation

The `SensorOfTemperature` class implements the `Sensor` interface and encapsulates the logic for managing the current temperature:

```java
public class SensorOfTemperature implements Sensor {
    // Implementation of the class
}

protected SensorOfTemperature(DeviceId deviceId, SensorModelName sensorModelName) {
    // Implementation of the constructor
    this.value = new TemperatureValue(25.0); //Default value
}

@Override
public Value getValue() {
    // Implementation of the method
}
```

The `TemperatureValue` class, implements the `Value` interface and encapsulates the current temperature value, ensuring immutability and
data integrity.

```java
public class TemperatureValue implements Value {
    // Implementation of the class
}

public TemperatureValue(double temperatureValue) {
    // Implementation of the constructor
}

@Override
public String valueToString() {
    // Implementation of the method
}
```
