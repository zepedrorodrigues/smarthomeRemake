# Acceptance Criteria

## Sensor of Solar Irradiance

- `Scenario 1:` Create and associate a sensor of solar irradiance with a device.
    - **Given** the system is equipped with devices.
    - **When** a user requests to add a sensor of solar irradiance to a device.
    - **Then** the system should be able to create and save a sensor of solar irradiance.


- `Scenario 2:` Retrieving the current solar irradiance from a device.
    - **Given** the system is equipped with devices that have solar irradiance sensors.
    - **When** a user requests the current solar irradiance from a device(sensor).
    - **Then** the system should provide the current solar irradiance.
